# PubSweet App

Welcome to the skeleton application!

## Quickstart

```bash
pubsweet start   # or npm start
```

This will use Docker to get you up and running quickly. See `pubsweet` docs for
troubleshooting and other ways to start the app.

## Customising the skeleton application

- Change `name` in `package.json` to your desired name
- Modify app config in the `/config` directory and webpack config in `/webpack`.
- Run `pubsweet add <components>` or `pubsweet remove <components>` to add or
  remove components.
- Rewrite this README!
